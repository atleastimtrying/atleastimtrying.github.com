        <h2>Project title</h2>
        <p>Here is a description of the project as it is going and thats going to be about it. I suspect it will be a few paragraphs explaining what it is and why I'm doing it, perhaps this will be done perhaps it won't, what's important is that I'm exercising my coding brain. It seems that I will need to make this paragraph longer to test out css resizing properties, It'll be cracking if this works I'll be honest with you I might wee my pants.
